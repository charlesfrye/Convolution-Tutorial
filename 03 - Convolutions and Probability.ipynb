    "The [Why Are Convolutions Useful?](02%20-%20Why%20Are%20Convolutions%20Useful%3F.ipynb) notebook focuses on the role of convolutions in signal processing, with connections to neuroscience. But as noted in the [What's a Convolution?](01%20-%20What's%20a%20Convolution%3F.ipynb) notebook, convolutions are a very general mathematical idea -- much more than a simple way of expressing what linear, time-invariant transformations do to signals. In fact, they arise whenever we need to keep track of multiple possible contributions to a given value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook works through an example of how convolutions arise in this way in probability theory. It assumes a small degree of familiarity with convolutions (so read through the other notebooks first!) and probability. If your probability is rusty, I recommend [this blog post on Bayes' Rule](http://charlesfrye.github.io/stats/2016/02/04/bayes-rule.html), which begins with a primer on probability."

    "Apart from this somewhat artificial example, why would we care about these distributions we're calculating using convolutions?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've ever taken the mean of a dataset, then you should care! The values in our dataset are random numbers -- each time we run an experiment or collect some data, we get different values. When we calculate the mean, we have to first add them together. We then divide by the number of values in our dataset to get the mean. Dividing doesn't change the shape of a distribution, just the width. So the mean itself has a distribution -- we get a different, random value of the mean each time we run the same experiment or collect the same data -- and that distribution is given by repeatedly convolving the distribution that governs individual datapoints with itself (and then scaling by the number of datapoints).\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, this distribution, also known as the *sampling distribution of the mean* has a characteristic shape. If you haven't already, increase the number of iterations to 25 or more. Try each of the distributions in turn. You should see that the same basic shape results each time: a bell curve, also known as a *Gaussian distribution* or a *normal distribution*. The proof of this fact is known as the *Central Limit Theorem*, and most proofs use properties of convolution in order to demonstrate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "These proofs go beyond the scope of this tutorial, but a quick sneak peak: the result of convolving two Gaussian distributions is another Gaussian distribution. That makes the family of Gaussians a *fixed-point* of the convolution operation. Any other pair of distributions (subject to technical restrictions) are moved closer to this fixed-point by convolution."
