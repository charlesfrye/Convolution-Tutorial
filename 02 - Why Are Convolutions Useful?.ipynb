If we view our convolution operation as a function that takes a signal as input and produce a signal as output, the kernel represents the output signal for an input signal that's just a single data point with the value 1, presented at time 0. We get the total output for a signal with many points at different times and with different values by adding together the kernel responses to each point.

One example might be the transformation between the total input to a neuron to its firing rate. A very simple model would say that when input is below a threshold value, firing rate is 0, and then firing rate rises linearly as input increases above that value (this is the response function of a [leaky integrator neuron](http://charlesfrye.github.io/FoundationalNeuroscience/25/)).
