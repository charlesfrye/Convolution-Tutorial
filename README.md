# Convolution-Tutorial

Three tutorial notebooks on convolutions. No background knowledge is assumed.

1. *What's A Convolution?* covers the basics -- where does the convolution formula come from?
2. *Why Are Convolutions Useful?* shows some traditional applications of convolution to audio and image processing.
3. *Convolutions and Probability* works through a somewhat surprising application of convolution in adding up random numbers.
